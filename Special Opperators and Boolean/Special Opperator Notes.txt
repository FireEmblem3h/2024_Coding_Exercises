= =	(This is equal to that)

!=	(This is NOT equal to that)

>	(This is greater than that)

< 	(This is less than that)

>=	(This is greater than OR equal to that)

<=	(This is less than OR equal to that)


Ex. (7 > 10)  //False

Next, we learned about if and else statements. An else statement is always linked to an if statement. ALL if statements must include a condition to follow. 

&&	(Logical AND meaning both statements must follow each other. If both are 	true, then the whole statement is true. Otherwise the entire argument is 	false.)

||	(Logical OR means only ONE statement has to be true for the entire 	argument to be true. If both statements are false, then the whole statement 	will be false.)

!	(NOT)

Ex. (7 > 5 || x > 10), so the entire statement is true because 7 > 5.
